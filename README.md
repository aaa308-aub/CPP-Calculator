# CPP CALCULATOR
A C++ Calculator for basic operations.

# GOAL
To learn how to work on a project in C++ especially while handling dynamic memory, abstract syntax trees, invalid inputs, precision limits and fast arithmetic.

# FEATURES
* Supports basics operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
* Supports nesting with parentheses and negation i.e. unary minus
* Follows the proper rules of associativity and precedence
* Supports operator chains for signness as long as the chain is valid
* Raises the appropriate errors when user input expression is invalid
* Supports values with great orders of magnitude (up to around 10^300 currently) and with high precision (currently set to 12 digits of precision)
